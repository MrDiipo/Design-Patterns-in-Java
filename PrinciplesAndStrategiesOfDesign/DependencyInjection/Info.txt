- A java class has a dependency on another class, if it uses an instance of this class
    -referred to as class dependency
    -a class which accesses a logger service has a dependency on this service class

-Java classes should be as independent as possible from other java classes
    - this increases the possibility of reusing the classes and to be able to test them independently from other classes

-If a java class creates an instance of another class via the new operator, it cannot be used and tested independently from this class.
    - this is called a hard dependency

-dependency injection solve these "hard" dependencies
