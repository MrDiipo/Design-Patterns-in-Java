This principle defines that objects of a superclass can be replaceable with objects of it subclasses without breaking the application.
- It requires the object of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass
- It requires that methods which use a superclass type must be able to work with the subclass without any issues.

Java supports this principle supports this principle naturally.
